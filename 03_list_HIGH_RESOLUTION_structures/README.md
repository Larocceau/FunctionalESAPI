# list_HIGH_RESOLUTION_structures

== FunctionalESAPI ==
 
def: 
* Lists high-resolution structures which are not empty

why: 
* sometimes we have several structures needed to be high resolution
* real oar and all relevant optimization structures
* easier to see all in a seperate list while checking a plan

roadmap:
1. get relevant structures from structure set
2. save the list as html in tmp folder
3. show the html using default browser
